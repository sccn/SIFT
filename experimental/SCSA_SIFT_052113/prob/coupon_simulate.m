function [ coupon, n_coupon, seed ] = coupon_simulate ( n_type, seed )

%% COUPON_SIMULATE simulates the coupon collector's problem.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The coupon collector needs to collect one of each of N_TYPE
%    coupons.  The collector may draw one coupon on each trial,
%    and takes as many trials as necessary to complete the task.
%    On each trial, the probability of picking any particular type
%    of coupon is always 1 / N_TYPE.
%
%    The most interesting question is, what is the expected number
%    of drawings necessary to complete the collection?
%    how does this number vary as N_TYPE increases?  What is the
%    distribution of the numbers of each type of coupon in a typical
%    collection when it is just completed?
%
%    As N increases, the number of coupons necessary to be
%    collected in order to get a complete set in any simulation
%    strongly tends to the value N_TYPE * LOG ( N_TYPE ).
%
%    If N_TYPE is 1, the simulation ends with a single drawing.
%
%    If N_TYPE is 2, then we may call the coupon taken on the first drawing
%    a "Head", say, and the process then is similar to the question of the
%    length, plus one, of a run of Heads or Tails in coin flipping.

%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, integer N_TYPE, the number of types of coupons.
%
%    Input, integer SEED, a seed for the random number generator.
%
%    Output, integer COUPON(N_TYPE), the number of coupons of each type
%    that were collected during the simulation.
%
%    Output, integer N_COUPON, the total number of coupons collected.
%
%    Output, integer SEED, a seed for the random number generator.
