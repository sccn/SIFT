function [ x, seed ] = uniform_01_order_sample ( n, seed )

%% UNIFORM_01_ORDER_SAMPLE samples the Uniform 01 Order PDF.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    In effect, this routine simply generates N samples of the
%    Uniform 01 PDF; but it generates them in order.  (Actually,
%    it generates them in descending order, but stores them in
%    the array in ascending order).  This saves the work of
%    sorting the results.  Moreover, if the order statistics
%    for another PDF are desired, and the inverse CDF is available,
%    then the desired values may be generated, presorted, by
%    calling this routine and using the results as input to the
%    inverse CDF routine.

%  Parameters:

%    Input, integer N, the number of elements in the sample.
%
%    Input, integer SEED, a seed for the random number generator.
%
%    Output, real X(N), N samples of the Uniform 01 PDF, in
%    ascending order.
%
%    Output, integer SEED, an updated seed for the random number generator.
