Version: [$Version$]  
Author: Tim Mullen (tim@sccn.ucsd.edu)

## Acknowledgements

- Arnaud Delorme was instrumental in the development of the SIFT framework and integration into EEGLAB as well as contributing initial BrainMovie3D code.
- Christian Kothe contributed the arg() framework for function I/O and auto-GUI generation
- Wes Thompson consulted on statistics and methods for bayesian smoothing and multi-subject analysis
- Alejandro Ojeda contributed routines for fast ridge regression

SIFT makes use of routines from (or is inspired by) the following open-source packages:

- [ARFIT](https://github.com/tapios/arfit) (Schneider et al)
- [TSA/Biosig](http://octave.sourceforge.net/tsa/) (Schlögl et al)
- [Chronux](https://chronux.org) (Mitra et al)
- [DAL/SCSA](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~ryotat/softwares/dal/) (Tomioka / Haufe et al)
