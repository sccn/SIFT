This is a modified version of the toolbox.

Major changes:
* PropertyType accepts [] for types that are 'scalar'.
* The PropertyGrid can be constructed from an argument specification (as created by BCILAB's arg system).
* Unsupported Datatypes are automatically serialized into strings in the PropertyGrid (function handles, non-string cell arrays, structs)
* There are now properties with children whose value selects from different subtrees (e.g., a pulldown list to select from different children structures).
* An argument specification can be extracted from the PropertyGrid.
* The code has been more extensively commented.
