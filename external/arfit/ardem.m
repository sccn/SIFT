%  ARfit is a collection of Matlab modules for the modeling of
%  multivariate time series with autoregressive (AR) models. ARfit
%  contains modules for estimating parameters of AR models from given
%  time series data; for checking the adequacy of an estimated
%  AR model; for analyzing eigenmodes of an estimated AR model; and
%  for simulating AR processes.
%
%  This demo illustrates the use of ARfit with a bivariate AR(2)
%  process
%
%       v(k,:)' = w' + A1*v(k-1,:)' + A2*v(k-2,:)' + eta(k,:)',
%
%  where the row vectors eta(k,:) are independent and identically
%  distributed Gaussian noise vectors with zero mean and covariance
%  matrix C. The kth row v(k,:) of the 2-column matrix v represents an
%  observation of the process at instant k. The intercept vector w is
%  included to allow for a nonzero mean of the AR(p) process.

%  Let us simulate observations from a bivariate AR(2) process,
%  choosing the parameters

w = [ 0.25 ;  0.1 ];

% for the intercept vector,

A1 = [ 0.4   1.2;   0.3   0.7 ];

%  and

A2 = [ 0.35 -0.3;  -0.4  -0.5 ];

%  for the AR coefficient matrices, and 

C = [ 1.00  0.50;   0.50  1.50 ];

%  for the noise covariance matrix. The two 2x2 matrices A1 and A2 are
%  assembled into a single 2x4 coefficient matrix:

A = [ A1 A2 ];

%  We use the module ARSIM to simulate observations (time steps) of
%  this AR process. ARSIM and other modules in the ARfit collection
%  allow multiple realizations (trials) of the time series to be
%  simulated and used in estimation procedures. Let us simulate
%  ntr realizations with n observations each:
%
n   = 200;
ntr = 5;
v   = arsim(w, A, C, [n, ntr]);

%  The matrix v now contains the simulated time series. Each 2D
%  submatrix v(:,:,itr) contains a realization of the time series,
%  with the row index labeling observations (time steps) and the
%  column index labeling variables. The third index itr=1,...,ntr
%  labels the realizations.
%

%  Suppose that we have no information about how the time series
%  data v are generated, but we want to try to fit an AR model to the
%  time series. That is, we must estimate the AR model parameters,
%  including the model order. Assuming that the correct model order
%  lies between 1 and 5, we use the module ARFIT to determine the
%  optimum model order using Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion (SBC):
%
pmin = 1;
pmax = 5;
[west, Aest, Cest, SBC, FPE, th] = arfit(v, pmin, pmax);

%  The output arguments west, Aest, and Cest of ARFIT are the
%  estimates of the intercept vector w, of the coefficient matrix A,
%  and of the noise covariance matrix C. (The matrix th will be needed
%  later in the computation of confidence intervals.) These parameters
%  are estimated for a model of order popt, where the optimum model
%  order popt is chosen as the minimizer of an approximation to
%  Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion. The selected order popt in our
%  example is:

m    = 2;                 % dimension of the state space
popt = size(Aest, 2) / m;

disp(['popt = ', num2str(popt)])

clc

%  Besides the parameter estimates for the selected model, ARFIT has
%  also returned approximations to Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion SBC
%  and to Akaike's Final Prediction Error FPE, each for models of
%  order pmin:pmax. In this demo, the model order was chosen as the
%  minimizer of SBC. Here are the SBCs for the fitted models of order
%  1,...,5:

disp(SBC)
 
%  To see if using Akaike's Final Prediction Error as a criterion to
%  select the model order would have resulted in the same optimum
%  model order, compare the FPEs:

disp(FPE) 

%  Employing FPE as the order selection criterion, the optimum model
%  order would have been chosen as the minimizer of FPE. The values of
%  the order selection criteria are approximations in that in
%  evaluating an order selection criterion for a model of order p <
%  pmax, the first pmax-p observations of the time series are ignored.

%  Next it is necessary to check whether the fitted model is adequate
%  to represent the time series v. A necessary condition for model
%  adequacy is the uncorrelatedness of the residuals. The module ARRES
 
[siglev,res] = arres(west,Aest,v);

%  returns the time series of residuals res(:,:,itr) for each
%  realization itr=1,...,ntr of the original time series and the
%  significance level siglev with which a modified Li-McLeod
%  portmanteau test rejects the null hypothesis that the residuals
%  (using all available realizations) are uncorrelated. A model
%  passes this test if, say, siglev > 0.05.  In our example, the
%  significance level of the modified Li-McLeod portmanteau
%  statistic is 
 
disp(siglev); 

%  (If siglev is persistently smaller than about 0.05, even over
%  several runs of this demo, and if the number of realizations ntr
%  is not very large, then there is most likely a problem with the
%  random number generator that ARSIM used in the simulation of v.)

%  Using ACF, one can also plot the autocorrelation function of, say, 
%  the first component of the first realization of the time series
%  of residuals: 

acf(res(:,1,1));

%  95% of the autocorrelations for lag > 0 should lie between the
%  dashdotted confidence limits for the autocorrelations of an IID
%  process of the same length as the time series of residuals res.

%  Since uncorrelatedness of the residuals is only a necessary
%  condition for model adequacy, further diagnostic tests should, in
%  practice, be performed. However, we shall go on to the estimation
%  of confidence intervals.

%  Being reasonably confident that the model adequately represents the
%  data, we compute confidence intervals for the AR parameters with
%  the module ARCONF:

[Aerr, werr] = arconf(Aest, Cest, west, th);

%  The output arguments Aerr and werr contain margins of error such
%  that (Aest +/- Aerr) and (west +/- werr) are approximate 95%
%  confidence intervals for the individual AR coefficients and for the
%  components of the intercept vector w. Here is the estimated
%  intercept vector with margins of error for the individual
%  components in the second column:
