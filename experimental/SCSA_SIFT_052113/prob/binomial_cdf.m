function cdf = binomial_cdf ( x, a, b )

%% BINOMIAL_CDF evaluates the Binomial CDF.
%
%  Definition:
%
%    CDF(X)(A,B) is the probability of at most X successes in A trials,
%    given that the probability of success on a single trial is B.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    A sequence of trials with fixed probability of success on
%    any trial is known as a sequence of Bernoulli trials.

%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, integer X, the desired number of successes.
%    0 <= X <= A.
%
%    Input, integer A, the number of trials.
%    1 <= A.
%
%    Input, real B, the probability of success on one trial.
%    0.0D+00 <= B <= 1.0.
%
%    Output, real CDF, the value of the CDF.
