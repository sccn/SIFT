function [ x, seed ] = normal_01_vector ( n, seed )

%% NORMAL_01_VECTOR samples the standard normal probability distribution.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The standard normal probability distribution function (PDF) has
%    mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
%
%    This routine can generate a vector of values on one call.  It
%    has the feature that it should provide the same results
%    in the same order no matter how we break up the task.
%
%    Before calling this routine, the user may call RANDOM_SEED
%    in order to set the seed of the random number generator.
%
%  Method:
%
%    The Box-Muller method is used, which is efficient, but
%    generates an even number of values each time.  On any call
%    to this routine, an even number of new values are generated.
%    Depending on the situation, one value may be left over.
%    In that case, it is saved for the next call.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, integer N, the number of values desired.  If N is negative,
%    then the code will flush its internal memory; in particular,
%    if there is a saved value to be used on the next call, it is
%    instead discarded.  This is useful if the user has reset the
%    random number seed, for instance.
%
%    Input, integer SEED, a seed for the random number generator.
%
%    Output, real X(N), a sample of the standard normal PDF.
%
%    Output, integer SEED, an updated seed for the random number generator.
%
%  Local parameters:
%
%    Local, integer MADE, records the number of values that have
%    been computed.  On input with negative N, this value overwrites
%    the return value of N, so the user can get an accounting of
%    how much work has been done.
%
%    Local, real R(N+1), is used to store some uniform random values.
%    Its dimension is N+1, but really it is only needed to be the
%    smallest even number greater than or equal to N.
%
%    Local, integer SAVED, is 0 or 1 depending on whether there is a
%    single saved value left over from the previous call.
%
%    Local, integer X_LO_INDEX, X_HI_INDEX, records the range of entries of
%    X that we need to compute.  This starts off as 1:N, but is adjusted
%    if we have a saved value that can be immediately stored in X(1),
%    and so on.
%
%    Local, real Y, the value saved from the previous call, if
%    SAVED is 1.
%
  persistent made;
  persistent saved;
  persistent y;
%
%  I'd like to allow the user to reset the internal data.
%  But this won't work properly if we have a saved value Y.
%  I'm making a crock option that allows the user to signal
%  explicitly that any internal memory should be flushed,
%  by passing in a negative value for N.
